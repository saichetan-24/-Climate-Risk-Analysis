# ðŸ“Œ Week 2 Project â€“ Summary of Findings

âœ… Rainfall Dataset (EDA):
- Seasonal patterns observed across states.
- High annual rainfall in North-East states like Arunachal Pradesh.
- Clear peaks during monsoon months (Junâ€“Sep).

âœ… Water Quality Dataset (EDA):
- Key parameters analyzed: pH, BOD, Nitrate, Fecal Coliform, etc.
- Some states show high pollution levels (high coliform counts, low dissolved oxygen).

âœ… Data Transformation:
- Merged rainfall & water datasets by State.
- Cleaned missing values and scaled numeric features.

âœ… Feature Selection:
- Top water quality parameters influencing rainfall were identified.
- Example: **pH, Dissolved Oxygen, BOD** showed moderate correlations with rainfall.

ðŸ“Š Conclusion:
This analysis provides a foundation for understanding how **rainfall patterns** might relate to **water resource quality** across states. The cleaned and transformed dataset is now ready for predictive modeling in Week 3.
